<H3>The Plot Thickens</H3>
<P class=readaloud>After defeating the blood elemental the guards congratulate you on your victory and begin to assist the citizens injured in the attack.  The guard commander ushers you away to the Ducal Palace, where you enter a room with the three agents pursuing the Tome - the chief intelligence agent of Baldur's Gate, Lord Balkal, the First Reader of Candlekeep, Master Galimateas, and Magmoran, the priest of the church of Oghma.
<BR>

<BR>
Lord Balkal speaks first, "Thank you for dealing with the situation so expediently.  I have gathered all the pursuers of the book here for your convenience.  Please make your choice as to which of us shall take possession of this dangerous artifact.  I assure you their is no coercion here - Baldur's Gate is a city of free people."
<BR>

<BR>
============
<BR>
Netheril was an empire of sorcerer-kings.  It was a nation where magic flourished - indeed, to be a citizen of Netheril was to be a wielder of some arcane magic.  Non-magic users were slaves in ancient Netheril.
<BR>

<BR>
The nation was composed of various city-states, but these were not merely tribes with a loose alliance.  The city states of Netheril were flying fortresses of terrible power.  Each city was the domain of a mighty sorcerer - to be the ruler of a city, one had to prove their talent by crafting it.
<BR>

<BR>
The greatest of these sorcerers was a young half-elf named Karsus - an arcane prodigy.  He was the youngest ever to forge his own city, accomplishing the feat after only 14 years of age.  As he grew older, his arcane powers grew, as did his political influence within the Netherese government and his popularity among the peoples of the empire.  The Netherese won many wars and acquired a vast territory - eventually only the cities of Neverwinter and Baldur's Gate remained beyond their control.
<BR>

<BR>
Then the war came with the Phaerimm.  The Phaerimm are not a nation of men or elves, but rather a terrible race of demons who feed on raw, arcane magic.  Netheril's flying fortresses were the perfect feeding ground for these beasts.  One by one, the fortresses of Netheril were being destroyed.  
<BR>

<BR>
It was then that Karsus made his desperate attempt to save his empire.  Knowing that arcane magic alone could not defeat the Phaerimm, he performed a ritual attempting to usurp the power of the Goddess Mystryl, whose power enabled the use of magic in our world.  Karsus did not foresee the magnitude of Mystryl's responsibilities.  He took her power but could not regulate the flow of magic in the world, and in that moment, magic faltered.  The last thing he saw was the armada of Netheril cities crashing to the ground, as the magic that sustained them had failed.  
<BR>

<BR>
The Phaerimm, finding themselves stranded and with no source of magic to feed on, were starved to extermination, but the damage was done.  Netheril was no more.
<BR>

<BR>
At this point, X pauses, looking grimly out the window before he continues.
<BR>

<BR>
At least, that's what we thought.  We now know that at least one of the Netherese cities escaped into the Shadowfell just before Karsus' Folly.  No doubt they found themselves unable to return, as magic had failed all of the world and would not return for a century.  In the Shadowfell, the last of the Netherese waited.  What they did to survive for centuries in that plane, I do not know, but one thing is for certain - they have returned, and they are not the same people who they once were.
<BR>

<BR>
To be sure, the Netherese were always a proud people.  Arrogant, proud, and powerful.  They conquered because they believed their culture to be superior to all others, not out of desire for more land or wealth.  But those that have returned are different.  They wrap themselves in shadow and darkness and have a thirst for blood.  They have quickly reclaimed most of their ancient lands, but they seem to have little interest in expanding their population.  Our intelligence tells us that few survive any Netherese attack.  Furthermore, little is known about the new society of Netheril.  All we know is that the flying city of Shade is the seat of power, and its occupant is the High Prince of Netheril.  It is his agents that hunt you.
<BR>

<BR>
As to the nature of the jewel you carry, I can make only one conclusion:  it is a shard of Karsus.  You found it in the High Forest, where centuries ago several fortresses of Netheril were entombed.  You say that the Lady of Spellguard spoke of the Fall of Netheril when she beheld it, but also that it was beyond her power, which is not inconsiderable.  You tell me that it appears to have a will of its own, so it must be an artifact beyond the power of a mere enchanted jewel.  
<BR>
This pearl is a fragment of the soul of Karsus - indeed it is said that he was entombed in black stone after his battle with the goddess - and thus it is not only arcane but divine, for it undoubtedly holds a part of Mystryl's essence as well.  
<BR>

<BR>
The power of a god - even a dead god - is mighty indeed.  This is why the ruler of Netheril seeks it.  I fear if he obtains it, all the world may fall under his Shadow.</P>
<P>The characters are ordered to return to the Ducal Palace in Baldur's gate where
<BR>

<BR>
The characters can choose to return the tome to Candlekeep, Church of Oghma, or the city of Baldurs Gate.
<BR>

<BR>
The others are not pleased with their decision.  Agents make this plain.
<BR>

<BR>
The recipient nevertheless produces magical items - 
<BR>

<BR>
"For you, daring assassin, a ki focus of brutal power."
<BR>
(Devastating Ki Focus +2)
<BR>

<BR>
"For you, wise wizard, gauntlets that will whisk you away from harm."
<BR>
(bracers of escape)
<BR>

<BR>
"For you, noble paladin, a sword that will cut even the sturdiest steel."
<BR>
(Jagged Longsword + 3)
<BR>

<BR>
"For you, brave druid, a brooch that will make your magic more potent."
<BR>
(Healer's Brooch +2)
<BR>

<BR>
"And for you, we have the gift of information.  I will tell you the truth of what you carry.  It is a long tale, so please sit."
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
 The speaker will answer some questions:
<BR>

<BR>
Is the pearl unique - It may be, but maybe not.  It is possible there are others like it.
<BR>

<BR>
Netheril's activity - Netheril has been sending parties across the world in search of magical items.  They may be looking for objects of great power.</P>
<H3>Returning to the High Forest</H3>
<P class=readaloud>At this point Lord Balkal (butts in/continues), "I am afraid I cannot allow you to remain in the city.  The pearl represents a great danger as long as it stays here.  The Netherese will see us protecting it and consider it an act of war.  I cannot risk the city's fate in this way."
<BR>

<BR>
(allow for questions)
<BR>

<BR>
"Do not think that we are abandoning you - you have assisted us in several crucial matters now, and you have earned our friendship."  (Although he still looks displeased with you/The other two men in the room nod curtly, obviously still displeased with your choice)
<BR>

<BR>
"What we need now, more than anything, is information.  What you have just heard is all the information that each of us knows now.  This should worry us all," he says with a wry smile, "for among us I count a great scholar, a priest of the church of knowledge, and myself, a lord of spies."
<BR>

<BR>
"You told us that you found the pearl in the High Forest near the town of Loudwater and the warlock's icy spire.  Perhaps there are more clues to be found in the forest - it is likely to be the resting place of the city of Karse itself!  I think the best course of action is to investigate the forest thoroughly for more information."
<BR>

<BR>
-----
<BR>

<BR>
"Be on your guard.  The forest is dangerous enough, and the Netherese will be coming for you.  When you have gathered more information, return to us, here in the Ducal palace.  I am appointing you each as honorary captains of the Legions of the Flaming Fist," he says, handing you gold coins engraved with the crest of Baldur's Gate.  "Any member of our military will recognize these tokens and aid you in any way possible."  You notice a minor enchantment on the coins that seems to make them gleam with fire in their reflection.
<BR>

<BR>
"You may stay in the city until midday tomorrow, but then you must be gone."  And without another word, Lord Balkal turns and leaves the room, the other two men following behind them.</P>
<P>Allow time for shopping.  PCs have Approx 40k gold</P>
<H3>Ambushed on the road</H3>
<P class=readaloud>You make camp in the plains under starry night skies.  The air is still.  Many hours pass in silence.
<BR>

<BR>
Insight / Perception DC 20: You notice that there are no sounds of wildlife around you.  The air is too silent.
<BR>

<BR>
The moonlight suddenly reveals a figure staggering towards you.  "Please!", the man cries, "I was attacked by bandits.  I need help."  
<BR>

<BR>
(any kind of check DC 15 reveals something odd about the man - the way his skin gleams eerily, or that he has no wounds.")
<BR>

<BR>
(if the PCs are on guard)
<BR>

<BR>
The man suddenly stops and begins laughing - the sound of it hurts your ears. "I guess we should have known it wouldn't have been that easy."
<BR>

<BR>
--
<BR>

<BR>
Suddenly the man's form changes into a deathly visage, a shadow knight of the underworld.  He must be after the Pearl!  In the moonlight, you can make out ghostlike figures approaching - they must be wraiths.  The knight draws a black blade and attacks!</P>
<P>PCs make out for the forest.  They must make camp on for the night.  If they are prepared, they are not surprised by the Netherese strike force attack.
<BR>

<BR>
After the encounter, the pale reaver's belongings carry a note.  It is written in Netherese.
<BR>

<BR>
"A notice to citizens of Netheril:  the First Prince has issued this decree that recovery of lost Netherese artifacts is to be made a top priority.  Interested parties may enlist the aid of any shadovar in order to more quickly locate our lost treasures.  Any recovered artifacts should be immediately returned to the seventh legion, currently stationed at an archaeological dig in the High Forest over the remains of Karse.  Report directly to the commander, Prince Brennus Tanthul."</P>

<H3>The High Forest</H3>
<P class=readaloud>You make your way through the familiar paths of the High Forest and the Dire Wood, following the map on the note to reach the site of the archaeological dig.
<BR>

<BR>
Night is beginning to fall when you reach a clearing in the treeline: below you is a large valley ablaze with torchlight.  There is a large camp set up and a buzzing of activity as workers go about digging here and there.  There appears to be a large tunnel not unlike a mineshaft at the far end of the camp, leading underground somewhere.  Most of the people in the camp are humanoid and appear to be slaves - only here and there do you get a glimpse of a shadovar task master driving labor.  At the east end of the camp you see a set of large tents much cleaner and well-fashioned than the rest - this must be where Brennus resides.  
<BR>

<BR>
Positioned at the edges of the camp are sentries - again, most are human but a few Netherese seargants patrol the border as well.</P>
<H3>Enter the Camp: Trick the Netherese</H3>
<P class=readaloud>You make your way down to the camp.  You are stopped at the border of the camp by guards.  
<BR>

<BR>
"More treasure hunters, eh?"
<BR>

<BR>
PCs answer in the affirmative
<BR>

<BR>
"Make your way up to the commander's tents and find Itherian.  He'll give you your assignments."
<BR>

<BR>
Itherian is a shadovar clerk busying himself with paperwork.  He sees you and at once says "We need no further assistance - all of our positions have been filled.  Please leave the encampment immediately."
<BR>

<BR>
Freeform it from here.</P>
<P>This is a skill challenge for if the players decide to openly cooperate with the Netherese.
<BR>

<BR>
DC checks start out at moderate, go to hard at first failure.  PCs must make an arcana check (or something) every round to keep the magic of the pearl under wraps. (6 successes before 3 failures)

<H3>Entering the Camp: Stealth</H3>
<P class=readaloud>The camp has a decent guard, and it looks as though you may not be able to sneak past the Netherese until darkness falls, so you wait an hour until sundown.  Clouds gather, and as night descends, a thunderstorm begins, lightning flashes providing occasional illumination.</P>
<P>Every member of the party must make a stealth roll each round or be detected.
<BR>

<BR>
Itherian begins to look oddly at you, and then his face turns grim.  "You are not working for us, are you?  Do not speak - your lies do not impress me.  Guards!" he shouts, and at once, shadovar warriors materialize around you.
<BR>

<BR>
(if failing the stealth challenge)
<BR>
You are unable (to do whatever) in time.  A netherese shade cries "Guards!", and the air bursts with shadows around you - shadovar warriors are closing in on you.
<BR>

<BR>
---
<BR>

<BR>
There are too many - you make your way through the encampment, but the guards are enclosing you.  You find yourselves at the mouth of the underground tunnel - it is not unlike a mineshaft, and it appears hastily constructed.  There are more bursts of shadow, and the emerging shadovar draw their weapons!</P>
<P>If the party fails either skill challenge, a fight begins, forcing the party underground.  This combat continues until the party comes up with a good exit strategy, but they are cornered into the mineshaft.
<BR>

<BR>
Note - every 2 rounds, 2 more of each type of shadovar enter the battle.
<BR>

<BR>
The party must enter the mineshaft and close it off:
<BR>

<BR>
"You back in to the mineshaft, the shadovar bearing down upon you.  The  construction is shoddy - the shaft is only held up by wooden pillars.  Inside you construction tools and barrels of red flame oil."
<BR>

<BR>
DC 25 strength check to bring down the pillars - pillars have 50 hp / lighting the red flame oil destroys the mineshaft, but if the PCs are nearby, 3d8 damage.</P>

<H3>The Descent</H3>
<P class=readaloud>(if mine shaft collapses)
<BR>

<BR>
"The entrance to the mine shaft crumbles around you, billowing you with soil and dust so thick you have trouble breathing."
<BR>

<BR>
-----------------------------
<BR>
Darkness surrounds you - there is only the distant glow of torches lighting your descent into the earth.
<BR>

<BR>
-----
<BR>
The trek takes hours, and you begin to become disoriented - it is difficult to tell how far under the surface you are.  Eventually the shaft gives way to a natural cavern.  Rubble lies strewn about - fragments of a shattered city that fell from the sky.  You see a glimmer of reflection ahead and proceed.  
<BR>

<BR>
The view is breathtaking - a massive underground cavern, filled to the brim by the ruined city of Karse.  Even now it is magnificient - your view is lit by hundreds of floating obelisks shedding bright light above the city, no doubt relics that continue to function long after the fall of the city.  The beauty of the city is marred, however, by the uncountable number of human remains strewn about the wreckage.  Even around you lie several human skulls.
<BR>

<BR>
There is no time for anymore sightseeing, however - a gust of wind blasts at you, carrying a menacing message "Leave this place or meet your doom."
<BR>

<BR>
The air is still for a moment - the skulls begin to levitate and ghostly figures emanate from them, looking menacing and advancing towards you!
<BR>

<BR>
</P>
<P>If PCs successfully successfully enter the mine (without combat), they get a vial of oil of red flame (minor - coat your weapon, on hit - ongoing 5 fire damage)</P>

<H3>The City of Karse</H3>
<P class=readaloud>The city of Karse is vast and littered with the remains of the dead.  Here and there the magic of the city remains alive and well - the floating lanterns bask the streets in an eerie blue glow, and water runs endlessly in magical fountains.  
<BR>

<BR>
You come upon an intersection when you hear a rustling and the distinct sound of a bow flexing.  "Who's there?  Show yourselves or I'll fire!"
<BR>

<BR>
Stepping out from behind a pile of rubble is a middle aged half-elven woman, her hair the gold color autumn leaves.  She wears armor that has seen better days, and carries a long sword and a bow.  Her cloak bears a pin of silver in the shape of a harp and a crescent moon.  "I am Elariel Taias," she begins, "and I did not expect any company down here!  I am an explorer of the Crescent Moon Mercantile company."
<BR>

<BR>
---
<BR>

<BR>
Before you have a chance to answer Elariel, you hear the sound of oncoming footsteps and turn your head to see shadovar warriors sprinting around the corner.  A cry goes up - "Lord Xanros, we have found them!"  At once a burst of fluid shadow rushes through the group and materializes in the form of the shade who pitted his dragon against you in 
<BR>
Spellguard.
<BR>

<BR>
"Well, we meet again.  I knew Prince Tanthul was making a mistake allowing foreigners to meddle in our affairs. 
<BR>

<BR>
I will give you one last chance to hand over the Pearl - surely by now you know what you carry and the burden it becomes." 
<BR>
(reaches his hand out - pear levitates)
<BR>

<BR>
The Shade's entourage of soldiers begins to encircle you, and Elariel is nowhere to be found.
<BR>

<BR>
"I see now that the power of Karsus favors you, well, let us see if the dead god is right.  Face me in single combat"
<BR>
----
<BR>

<BR>
Just when your doom seems certain, Xanros screams with pain - an arrow burning with silver fire is protuding through his right shoulder.  He turns in blinding anger to see Elariel atop a nearby roof with her bow drawn with another arrow.  "Harper!", he screams, "I will have your soul for this!"
<BR>

<BR>
Calmly taking aim at Xanros, Elariel replies "You know what kind of arrow this is, shade.  Begone from this place or be destroyed."  Xanros breathes heavily for a moment and the bursts into shadow along with his entourage.  The arrow that was in his shoulder drops to the ground.
<BR>

<BR>
"That was a close one!  Everyone alright?"
<BR>

<BR>
"I am a member of the harpers, a secret society dedicated in this age to defeating the shadovar."
<BR>

<BR>
"We must reach the tower to recover anything of worth that might aid us in defeating the Netherese."</P>
<P>Elariel Taias is a harper.
<BR>

<BR>
Proposes bargain to explore the tower.  Xanros shows up.</P>

<H3>The Spire Karsus</H3>
<P class=readaloud>You reach a grand plaza in the center of the ghostly city, finding the base of the tower of Karsus.  It is immensely tall, overlooking the ruined city center.  Outside its gates stands a large statue of marble inlaid with mithril, depicting the dead archmage himself.
<BR>

<BR>
"Hurry inside!" beckons Elariel.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
The interior of the tower can only be described as opulent.  It seems hardly touched by the fall of the city.  Elariel leads you up floor after floor, guiding you through disabled traps laid by the ancient wizard before arriving at a large door.  "I was searching for a key before I found you," she says, producing a crystal keystone not unlike those you found in Spellguard.  She places the stone in the door's lock and it creaks open, revealing a large hall that must be the tower's library.  There are countless bookshelves filled with ancient tomes.  The hall is lighted by arcane candleholders made of the finest mithril.
<BR>

<BR>
---
<BR>
As you do X, the arcane candles suddenly burn red and runes shine on the marble floor, instantly erecting arcane barriers around you.  The candleholders begin dispersing a purple gas.  "Stranglemist!" cries Elariel.  "We have to get out of here, or we'll be dead in 2 minutes!"</P>

<H3>Karsus' Folly</H3>
<P class=readaloud>"Praise the gods" Elariel mutters, heaving heavily and coughing.  "I thought I was doomed for sure."
<BR>

<BR>
She looks at you, smiling, and says "That one makes us even, I suppose."
<BR>

<BR>
You journey for another 10 minutes upward without event before suddenly emerging onto the grand plateau atop the tower.  The view is breathtaking - all of the city is under your purview.
<BR>

<BR>
You are not caught up with the view for long, however, as the center of the plateau holds a far more interesting object:  an statue of blackest marble depicting an archmage clawing at the heavens, intense pain wracked across his features.  Here and there is an imperfection in the statue, where a piece of it was chipped away.
<BR>

<BR>
You begin to approach the statue when it alarmingly seems to look at you - this statue is alive!  "By the gods," exclaims Elariel, "it is Karsus himself, encased in a prison of stone."
<BR>

<BR>
The air shatters around you with a thunderous voice "Who dares disturb my rest!"  The statue's eyes begin to bleed.
<BR>

<BR>
"I am Lord Karsus, ruler of Netheril and conquerer of Mystryl.  I am a man and yet more than a man.  For two thousand years I have slumbered in my dream and yet now I awake.  Why is this so?  Did I not seal my fate when I killed the goddess?" the voice muses, seeming to forget that you are there.
<BR>

<BR>
"Unless...unless part of me was not lost in that battle.  And now that fragment of my soul has so graciously been returned to me."  
<BR>
At the embodied voice's words the Pearl tears itself from Ammon's neck and embeds itself upon the stone crown of the statue, filling in a small hole in his brow.  "I see...I see.  Part of me was separated, and how it has labored to bring me back!  It has played this group of adventurers for fools.  But you are not the only players.  Lord Shadow escaped my folly and even now seeks to return Netheril to glory from the Shadowfell."
<BR>

<BR>
"I must regenerate.  I must gather all the remaining pieces of my soul.  It will take some time, but now my will has returned."
<BR>

<BR>
Finally remembering that you are before him, the voice says "I thank you for your service.  I take no pleasure in your deaths.  I cannot yet take form, but the barest inkling of my power returns to me and I must use it to dispatch you."
<BR>

<BR>
The air hums with intensity as the statue suddenly becomes encased in adamantine stone.  A vicious roar fills the air around you.  "DRAGON!" shouts Elariel.
<BR>

<BR>
Sweeping on the air towards you is a dragon of mithril!</P>

<H3>Xanros Arrives</H3>
<P class=readaloud>The dragon gives a shout and collapses in death.  
<BR>

<BR>
"Amusing.  You are stronger than I sense.  It is no matter.  My old friends are coming to destroy you."
<BR>

<BR>
Bursting through the tower door is Xanros and his soldiers.  He grins and then an expression of awe comes over him as he notices Karsus.  "By the Raven Queen!" he exclaims, "Can it be?  Have you led us right to our goal?"  
<BR>

<BR>
"Yes, they have indeed, Tulien Xanros, first servant of the High Prince Tanthul Telamont, Lord Shadow, ruler of the city of Shade, last of the Netherese.  I am Karsus.  Our people are saved.  Dispatch these heroes."
<BR>

<BR>
Xanros springs to his feet, but Elariel is quicker, sending a shadowbane arrow flying at Xanros.  It misses and hits a soldier, who falls to his knees in pain, his body consumed by the flame.  
<BR>

<BR>
"Time for the backup plan!" she shouts, pulling out a scroll and beginning to mutter words in some lost language.  A portal tears itself open in the air just off the edge of the plateau.  "We've got to jump for it!" she screams, turning and running.</P>
<P>Athletics DC 15 to make the portal.  If you fail, the Netherese warriors catch you with an arrow, dealing 3d6 damage.</P>
